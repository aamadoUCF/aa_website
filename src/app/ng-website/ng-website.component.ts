                  <!-- Semi-detailed description of project -->
                  <p>I have always been interested in front-end development, but I was also just as much intimidated. 
                    It was something I never touched during my classes, but I felt that every software engineer should 
                    have some sort of experience with. Starting was very challenging, as with anything you do for the first time. 
                    With continuous practice, I was beginning to feel like I knew what I was doing.</p>

                  <br>

                  <p>This website was made using the Angular and Bulma frameworks. Bulma is a CSS framework that has many essential 
                    elements and provides easy to use organization for front-end devlopers of all skill levels. </p>
