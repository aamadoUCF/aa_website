# AA_Website

This ia my first website made using Angular, and I'm very excited to be able to learn about how it works. I definitely thought that web development would be insanely hard, but Angular seems to actual make the process easier.

This website features
- Home Page
- Projects Page
- About Me
- Hobbies

My end goal with this website is to host it on GitHub pages and to also associate a domain name with it. This is more so to stand as a website to show employers about my history and projects and to learn about web developement, specifically Angular.

Default Angular Description Below
--------------------

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 13.1.4.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
